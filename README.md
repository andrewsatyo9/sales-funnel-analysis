## 🗂 Dataset
The dataset consists of user interactions at different stages of the funnel:
1. **Home Page** → Entry point for users.
2. **Search Page** → Users search for products/services.
3. **Payment Page** → Users initiate the purchase process.
4. **Confirmation Page** → Successful transaction confirmation.

## 📉 Key Findings
